**Deprecation NOTE:** this repository is no longer maintained/updated to work with recent versions of Servoy.
You can use it as a starting point and adjust it yourself to be compatible with recent versions, but we recommend that you try out Servoy Cloud as an alternative: https://www.servoy.com/servoycloud/
Servoy Cloud will take away a lot of the hassle of building and maintaining a full build/test/deploy pipeline yourself.
